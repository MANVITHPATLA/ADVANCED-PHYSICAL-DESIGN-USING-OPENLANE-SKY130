# ADVANCED-PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130
1-week advanced physical design program using Open Lane/Sky130 conducted by VSD-IAT.

_SECTION A - Inception of open source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130PDK_

DAY 1: *"How to talk to computers"* implies Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs

Chip's refer to  integrated circuits that are the central part of the system.
